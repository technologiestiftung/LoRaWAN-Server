# Node.js backend for TTN/LoraWan

This is a rather basic Node.js setup for providing data through a web API via [TheThingsNetwork] (TTN).

The basic idea is having an Arduino with a sensor send data to TTN, then grab it from there and make it accessible through the web.

Our full tutorial can be found [here].

## Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

We assume a basic understanding of LoraWAN and TTN. You'll need an TTN account, register your node and enter the credentials in server.js
